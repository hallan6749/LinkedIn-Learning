Next steps
We've covered seven ways to apply each of the topics covered in ITIL Foundation. I hope I have removed some of the mystery on how to get started applying these concepts in ways that produce value for you, your team, and your organization. I have just one more thing. Some suggestions on where to go to learn and do more. Here are some great resources to begin with. On enlightening and empowering people, see John Kotter's book, "Leading Change." You can also learn more about improving moments of truth in Jan Carlzon's book of the same name, "Moments of Truth." On individuals, teams, and organizations reflecting and acting, see Reg Revans' book, "Action Learning." And for the concept of acting within your circle of influence, see Stephen Covey's book, "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People." Well, that's it. I know from personal experience how making seemingly small changes in thinking and action can make a big difference for individuals, teams, and organizations. So I wish you the best of luck in applying ITIL Foundation concepts, using the guidance you've learned in this course, to improve both the results you get and the quality of your everyday work life.
