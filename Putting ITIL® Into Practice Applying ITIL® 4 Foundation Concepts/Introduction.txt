ITILÂ® 4 in the real world
ITIL 4 updates the world's most popular IT service management guidance to include practices fit for today's agile and lean organizations and cloud technologies. ITIL clarifies the outcomes we must pursue to succeed at providing IT products and services. ITIL 4 updates the principles, practices, terminology, and models needed to achieve and sustain those outcomes to better fit the situation we find ourselves in today. The ITIL 4 Foundation course explains these concepts, But additional guidance is needed to apply them. That additional guidance is just what this course covers. In it, I'm going to show you how you might apply each concept covered in ITIL 4 Foundation, topic by topic. I'm Dave Pultorak, and I've contributed to ITIL and have been teaching people ITIL concepts and helping them to apply them for 20 years now. If you're ready to take your ITIL skills to the next level, then come join me in my LinkedIn Learning course and learn how to apply ITIL 4 Foundation concepts. This course is part of the Putting ITIL Into Practice series here on LinkedIn Learning, where we take up where ITIL leaves off.

What you should know
You should have taken an ITIL 4 Foundation course. Have those materials handy, including the ITIL 4 Foundation exam specification, or syllabus, and the ITIL 4 glossary to refer to, as we'll reference but not replicate the topics they cover when we cover how to apply them.
